# drug-induced_morphology_changes_quantification
I treated iPSC with FDA approved drugs, stained them with neurite and nuclear markers and obtained confocal fluorescent images. Now, the goal is to quantify the change of neurites in each condition, namely 3 parameters: amount of trunk-branches (neurite branching from the body of the cell), non-trunk branching and mean length of neurites.
